# Decription:
- This project combined my 2 passions; weather and coding. This application was built using Flask, and allowed me to develop a better understanding of how to utilize APIs.
- The application takes a user location either with HTML5 geolocation or manual zip code entry, and checks the weather observation and plays music according the the weather observations.
- There are 5 general categories: Sun, Cloud, Rain, Storm, Snow
- You can access these directly by simply adding /Sun, / Cloud, /Rain, etc. after the demo link below, but you won't get the weather oberservation data due to a lack of location input. For the full experience, access the page directly below and input a location. 

# Demo: https://weather-music-flask.herokuapp.com/
- guest account: [Username: guest & Password: guest] as a means to check out the CRUD functionality on the simplistic profile page.

# Technologies/Libraries:
- Flask framework & Jinja2
- SQLAlchemy Library
- Regular Expressions Library
- Javascript
- AJAX - I know it isn't a language, but I found it to be very useful and provides so much possibility
- HTML5
- CSS3
