# Decription:
- This project combined my 2 passions; weather and coding. This application was built using Flask, and allowed me to develop a better understanding of how to utilize APIs.
- The application takes a user location either with HTML5 geolocation or manual zip code entry, and checks the weather observation and plays music according the the weather observations.
- There are 5 general categories: Sun, Cloud, Rain, Storm, Snow

# Demo: https://weather-music-flask.herokuapp.com/
